# Terminal Chat
Terminal chat application for Assignment 1

## Get Started
We have set up a python application that will be your chat client for both assignment 1 and assignment 2. Please execute the following steps in order to get the chat parser working on your computer

1. Clone this repo TerminalChat from GitHub
2. Navigate to the folder where you have cloned the TerminalChatBar in the Terminal
3. Run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the command `python3 terminal_chatbot.py **server_url**`

Note: **server_url** is the url for the server you are creating that will interact with this. Please add the exact URL that you see from your running Flask app (e.g. "http://127.0.0.1:5000")
